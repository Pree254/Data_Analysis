--  Rich countries were not shielded from death tolls or economic decline.

-- Health and economic crises go hand in hand because Poor COVID responses damaged economies further.

-- Data gaps matter: Missing data undermines fair international comparisons and responses.

-- Regional differences: WHO region analysis reveals that recovery paths must be tailored â€” there's no one-size-fits-all strategy
