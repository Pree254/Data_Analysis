## Economic implications
###Task 3  
The data reveals that several European countries with high COVID-19 death rates—such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Italy—suffered not only significant public health crises but also considerable economic consequences. These nations likely experienced sharp GDP contractions due to a combination of labor supply shocks, reduced consumer confidence, and prolonged lockdowns that disrupted aggregate demand and supply chains. The elevated mortality rates placed immense fiscal pressure on governments, necessitating a reallocation of resources toward public health expenditure and expanding social safety nets, often at the expense of long-term investments. In contrast, countries with lower death rates demonstrated greater economic resilience, maintaining higher levels of labor productivity and enabling a faster post-pandemic recovery trajectory. However, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, despite lower death rates, the prevalence of informal employment and limited social protection coverage posed challenges to inclusive and sustained recovery. Overall, the disparity in death rates highlights how public health outcomes directly influence macroeconomic stability, shaping both short-term disruptions and long-term recovery prospects.
